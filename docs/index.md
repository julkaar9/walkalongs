# Welcome to walkalongs
walkalongs are resources and solutions of various technologies
that I am currently learning. These are not meant to be tutorials so it is very likely 
most solutions will not have detailed explanations.  
These are not walkthroughs but *walkalongs !* 

## Try it yourself
You may wish to solve the questions yourself. Clone the repo and install the requirements.  
`pip install -r requirements.txt`  
### Running the django orm notebooks (Django Shell-plus)
cd into `server/notebook` Then open the notebook using `python ../manage.py shell_plus --notebook`
